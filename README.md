# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
This project adjusts a pre-existing web app using BeautifulSoup and Splinter. To do this, I scraped full-resolution images and titles, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data and altered the design of the web app to accomodate the images. 


## Resources
Software: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Flask, PyMongo, MongoDB, HTML5, Bootstrap 3
